# STCollection

STCollection contains matrices that have been used for testing LAPACK's symmetric tridiagonal eigensolvers and bidiagonal SVD algorithms. 
The collection includes symmetric tridiagonal matrices and (upper) bidiagonal matrices. The original set of matrices in the collection has 
been described in the paper Marques, Demmel, Voemel and Parlett. A Testing Infrastructure for Symmetric Tridiagonal Eigensolvers, ACM TOMS, 
35:2008. Difficult cases, and cases that expose bugs in LAPACK, are continuously added to the collection.
