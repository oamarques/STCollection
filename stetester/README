Contents of this directory:
==========================

INPUT     : input files and options accepted by STETESTER
INSTALL   : compilation options for different architectures
LIB       : reserved for module files and the STETESTER library 
Makefile  : generates the STESTER library and executables
make.inc  : include file (platform specifics) for Makefile
README    : this file
README.in : describes the options for _STETESTER
SRC       : source files

Platform specifics:
==================

The subdirectory INSTALL contains a set of configurations/platforms
on which STETESTER has been compiled and tested. (Some configurations
are kept for reference only, as STETESTER has evolved over the years.)

Installation steps:
==================

1) Copy one of the files in the subdirectory INSTALL into ./make.inc 
   and edit it to accommodate:
   - compilation options,
   - LAPACK and BLAS libraries to be used,
   - location of the STETESTER library,
   - interfaces for the timing function and flops counting.
2) Generate the STETESTER library and executables by doing a "make" 
   - dstetester.x: double precision version
   - sstetester.x: single precision version
3) Run the tester: "dstetester.x < INPUT/input_test_easy". 
   With this simple input file (and upon successful completion) five
   output files are generated:
   - dstetester_dump.log (timing, residuals, orthogonality level)
   - dstetester_dump.m   (results in a Matlab script)
   - dstetester_dump.T   (tridiagonal matrices used in the tests)
   - dstetester_dump.W   (eigenvalues computed by the various solvers)
   - dstetester_dump.Z   (eigenvectors computed by the various solvers)

See README.in and the INPUT subdirectory for additional information 
about the options used in the tests. The input files in INPUT may
point to the DATA directory. A link to the directory should be
specified or the input files should be edited accordingly.

Input files:
===========

The subdirectory INPUT contains examples of input files for STETESTER
and a list of all options accepted by STETESTER. Explicit matrices and
eigenvalue distributions (from which symmetric tridiagonal matrices 
can be generated) are stored in the subdirectory DATA. 

Notes:
=====

1) Some architectures are unable to read the matrix T_zenios.dat in 
   single precision.
2) The subroutine stegr available in LAPACK 3.0 may hang (infinite
   loop) for some difficult test cases. Known problems have been
   corrected in LAPACK 3.1.
